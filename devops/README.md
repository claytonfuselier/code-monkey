These are scripts I've created to perform bulk updates to articles in a code based wiki in Azure DevOps (ADO), but they may also be useful in other scenarios.

If you need help getting started, [this wiki page](https://github.com/claytonfuselier/code-monkey/wiki) will walk you through setting up VS Code and cloning your ADO repo locally.
